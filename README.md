OWA-EPANET
======

**EPANET** is an industry-standard program for modeling the hydraulic and water quality behavior of water distribution system pipe networks. The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit is a library of functions (or API) written in C that allow programmers to customize the use of EPANET's solution engine for their own applications. Both EPANET and its toolkit were originally developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). If you are interested in using/extending the EPANET engine and its API for academic, personal, or commercial use, then you've come to the right place. [Read more about EPANET on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPANET). (Please note that this project covers only the EPANET hydraulic and water quality solver engine, not the graphical user interface.)

## INSTALLATION

Instructions for building the OWA-EPANET Toolkit's function library as well as its command line executable from the source files in this repository can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenWaterAnalytics/EPANET/blob/master/BUILDING.md).

## USAGE

See the [full documentation](http://wateranalytics.org/EPANET/) of the OWA-EPANET API, along with examples of how to use the toolkit for water distribution system analysis. Additional information may be found on this project's [Wiki](https://github.com/openwateranalytics/epanet/wiki).
